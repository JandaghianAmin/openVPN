Setting up a VPN (Virtual Private Network) server in Ubuntu involves more complex configuration and security considerations compared to a simple proxy server. Here, I'll provide you with a general overview of setting up an OpenVPN server, which is a popular VPN solution.

Please note that setting up a VPN server requires careful attention to security, network configuration, and client management. Here's a high-level guide to get you started with setting up an OpenVPN server on Ubuntu:

1. **Install OpenVPN:**
   Open a terminal and install OpenVPN using the package manager:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install openvpn
   ```

2. **Generate Certificates and Keys:**
   OpenVPN requires certificates and keys for encryption and authentication. You can use the easy-rsa tool included with OpenVPN to generate these:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install easy-rsa
   ```

   Then, copy the easy-rsa scripts to a directory you can work in:

   ```bash
   mkdir ~/openvpn-ca
   cp -r /usr/share/easy-rsa/* ~/openvpn-ca/
   ```

   Edit the `vars` file inside the `~/openvpn-ca` directory to customize your certificate settings:

   ```bash
   nano ~/openvpn-ca/vars
   ```

   After editing, run the following commands to initialize the certificate authority:

   ```bash
   cd ~/openvpn-ca
   source vars
   ./clean-all
   ./build-ca
   ```

   Follow the prompts to create your CA (Certificate Authority) certificate.

3. **Generate Server Certificate and Key:**
   Create the server certificate and key:

   ```bash
   ./build-key-server server
   ```

   Follow the prompts and set a passphrase for the server key. 

4. **Generate Diffie-Hellman Parameters:**
   Generate Diffie-Hellman parameters for key exchange:

   ```bash
   ./build-dh
   ```

5. **Create HMAC Signature:**
   Generate an HMAC signature for additional security:

   ```bash
   openvpn --genkey --secret keys/ta.key
   ```

6. **Copy Files:**
   Copy the necessary files to the OpenVPN configuration directory:

   ```bash
   sudo cp keys/{server.crt,server.key,ca.crt,dh2048.pem,ta.key} /etc/openvpn
   ```

7. **Copy Sample Configuration:**
   Copy the sample server configuration file:

   ```bash
   zcat /usr/share/doc/openvpn/examples/sample-config-files/server.conf.gz | sudo tee /etc/openvpn/server.conf
   ```

8. **Edit Configuration:**
   Edit the OpenVPN configuration file:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/openvpn/server.conf
   ```

   Customize the configuration based on your requirements. Pay attention to settings like subnet, DNS servers, and routes.

9. **Start OpenVPN:**
   Start and enable the OpenVPN service:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start openvpn@server
   sudo systemctl enable openvpn@server
   ```

10. **Client Configuration:**
    Create client certificates and configuration files using similar steps as the server, then distribute them to your clients.

11. **Firewall Rules:**
    Configure your firewall to allow OpenVPN traffic. For example, if you're using UFW:

   ```bash
   sudo ufw allow OpenSSH
   sudo ufw allow 1194/udp
   sudo ufw enable
   ```

12. **Test the VPN:**
    Test the VPN connection from a client device. You can use the OpenVPN client software to connect.

Remember, this is a simplified overview. Configuring a VPN server requires careful attention to security, firewall rules, network settings, and client management. It's recommended to consult the official OpenVPN documentation and other resources for a comprehensive setup tailored to your specific needs.
